No raw passwords.
“Give the app my WP username & password” is a security anti-pattern.
Fix: Use WordPress Application Passwords (WP ≥5.6) or OAuth via a small house plugin you ship. Create a dedicated “service account” per site with least-privilege caps (e.g., edit_posts, edit_published_posts, not manage_options).

Don’t let an LLM “code inside” live WordPress.
Direct edits to theme/plugin files via the admin editor is how sites get bricked.
Fix: All code changes should go through your plugin exposing safe, narrow actions (e.g., “add schema markup,” “create internal links,” “create draft post”), and a GitOps path for any PHP/JS/CSS updates: PR → CI (lint, PHPCS, unit tests) → staging → approvals → deploy.

Human-in-the-loop by default.
Pure autopublish will burn you (brand, facts, YMYL niches).
Fix: Require approval for new pages/posts, especially in YMYL (health/finance/legal). Allow “trusted categories” to autopublish once quality scores & history are strong.

SEO scope realism.
You can own on-page + a chunk of technical SEO. You cannot guarantee rankings; off-page signals (links, authority) aren’t safely automatable.
Fix: Promise measurable levers you control (content cadence, on-page optimization, Core Web Vitals, indexing hygiene), not ranking guarantees.

Observability & rollbacks.
“Keep logs forever” without a plan means liability + cost.
Fix: Structured audit logs (who/what/when), searchable diffs, one-click revert using WP revisions/backups, and retention policies (e.g., hot 90 days, warm 1 year, cold archive after).

Quotas & rate limits.
PageSpeed Insights, Search Console, GA4, model APIs all have quotas.
Fix: Central rate limiter, backoff/retry, and a scheduler that batches large portfolios.

Page builders & custom fields.
Elementor/Divi/ACF/Custom Post Types break naive “create post” flows.
Fix: Your plugin should detect active builders and map fields/blocks; support Gutenberg blocks first; add adapters for major builders as milestones.

Brand/E-E-A-T.
Generic AI content won’t rank.
Fix: Per-client style guide, brand glossary, citation policy, expert reviewer, author bios with Person schema, and “Reviewed by [expert]” patterns. Pull client knowledge via RAG (vector store) to anchor facts.

Legal & privacy.
You’ll be processing client content and analytics.
Fix: DPA, GDPR/CCPA posture, encryption at rest/in transit, SCIM/SSO for team access, bring-your-own LLM keys option, data residency choices.

Don’t rely on WP-Cron.
It’s request-driven and unreliable.
Fix: Use your own scheduler/queue (e.g., Celery/SQS/Cloud Tasks) and push tasks via REST to sites.

A better architecture (high-level)

Agent Orchestrator

Plans tasks from playbooks (“Publish 2 posts/week”, “Fix CWV issues on top 20 pages”).

Calls narrow tools (functions) you define; no free-form “code this on prod.”

WordPress Connector (Your Plugin)

Auth: Application Passwords/OAuth → JWT.

Exposes safe endpoints:

POST /content/draft, POST /content/publish

POST /internal-links/suggest

POST /schema/apply

POST /media/optimize

POST /redirects/upsert

GET /site/inventory (CPTs, taxonomies, ACF)

Guards: capability checks, allow-list of actions, server-side validation.

Content Pipeline

Keyword/topic clustering → briefs (search intent, H2s, entities, FAQs).

Draft → fact-check (RAG to client docs), plagiarism scan, toxicity/PII scan.

On-page optimizer (title/meta, headings, entities, schema, internal links).

Editorial scorecard (readability, uniqueness, E-E-A-T checks).

Human review → publish/schedule → internal link updates → ping sitemaps.

Technical SEO Worker

Audits (sitemaps, robots, canonicals, hreflang, 404/redirects, pagination).

CWV fixes via config orchestration (CDN/cache, image compression, lazyload) not ad-hoc code. Integrations with Cloudflare/WordPress cache plugins via APIs.

Monitoring & Analytics

Google Search Console (search queries, CTR, coverage).

GA4 (engagement, conversion proxies).

PageSpeed Insights/Lighthouse + CrUX (lab + field).

Error budgets and thresholds → alerts & auto-tickets.

Storage & Safety

Postgres for metadata; S3/GCS for artifacts; vector DB for brand knowledge.

Secrets manager; per-tenant isolation; full audit trail.

What the tool actually does (clearly defined)

Automations (playbooks):

“Maintain posting cadence”: ensure ≥2 posts/week per site, backfill if missed, reschedule around holidays.

“On-page hygiene”: titles, metas, structured data, alt text, canonical, internal links, image compression, lazy load, LQIP.

“Indexability guardrails”: no orphan pages, correct robots/meta, sitemap parity, 404/301 governance.

“CWV improvements”: identify render-blocking, image weight, excessive DOM; trigger plugin/CDN configs and open tickets for dev-level tasks with suggested diffs.

“Content refresh”: detect decay, rework top-decay pages quarterly.

“Localization (optional)”: hreflang, language variants, translation workflow (human review required).

Dashboards (multi-tenant, agency-friendly):

Portfolio overview: health score, cadence status, tasks in progress.

Content calendar (draft → scheduled → published), with diff previews.

KPI tiles: clicks/CTR (GSC), top queries, CWV pass rate, index coverage.

Change log with filters (site, action, actor, impact).

Report exports (white-label PDF/CSV) + API.

Implementation notes you’ll thank yourself for later

Scoping & roles: Use Editor for content actions; a separate Admin-scoped service account only if/when needed for technical tasks—and keep those actions extremely limited.

Topic intelligence: Build keyword clusters with embeddings + SERP scraping via a provider; map clusters to hub pages → topic authority roadmap.

Internal links: Maintain a per-site vector index to suggest links; write via your plugin with safeguards (max N inserts/change, no changes to nav/menus without approval).

Schema: JSON-LD blocks for Article, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, Person/Organization, Product if WooCommerce; validate before publish.

Images: Auto WebP/AVIF variants, responsive srcset, captions/alt from the brief, dedupe media library.

Multisite & builders: Detect CPTs, ACF fields, and page builders on connect; show a compatibility matrix; degrade gracefully to draft-only for exotic setups.

Testing: Pre-publish checks (HTML validity, accessibility lint, broken link scan). Post-publish smoke (200 status, indexed in sitemap, internal link updates).

Safety rails for the model: No tool can run unless the plan references a known playbook and passes a policy checker (idempotency, bounded changes, dry-run preview size ≤ X, total edits/day/site ≤ Y).

Cost control: Per-site token budgets; batch PSI/GSC calls; nightly aggregation jobs; cold-store old logs.

API integrations (pragmatic set)

WordPress: REST + your plugin endpoints; media upload; revisions; schedules. Prefer Application Passwords.

Google:

Search Console (performance, coverage, URL inspection for sample URLs),

PageSpeed Insights (Lighthouse lab) + CrUX (field data),

GA4 (engagement metrics).
Note: Google Indexing API is officially limited to job postings & live streams; don’t promise general force-indexing.

CDN/Cache (optional orchestration): Cloudflare API (cache purge, APO), WP Rocket/LSCache toggles.

Rank tracking (optional, paid): Semrush/Ahrefs/SerpAPI—be transparent about ToS.

Quality & compliance guardrails

E-E-A-T: Attribute content to real authors; include bios, review notes, and citations.

Fact-checking: RAG to client docs; enforce citation density for factual claims.

Sensitive niches: Always human approval in YMYL; stronger review checklist.

Plagiarism/dup-content: Run a similarity check before publish; canonicalize where needed.

Accessibility: Enforce alt text, color contrast checks, heading order.

Data protection: Encrypt secrets, rotate creds, IP allow-listing for admin endpoints.

MVP you can ship (and not drown)

V0 (4–6 weeks of focused build):

Connect site (Application Passwords).

Read-only audits: indexability + on-page + PSI snapshots.

Content calendar & reporting (no writes).

V1:

Draft posts from briefs (kept in WordPress as draft), schema & internal link suggestions.

Scheduled publishing after approval; 2×/week cadence enforcement.

Automated metas/alt text updates (safe writes).

V2:

Decay detection & refresh playbook.

Limited technical changes via orchestrations (CDN/cache, redirects, images).

Multi-site portfolio dashboard, white-label reports, usage budgets.

Red flags to avoid in your pitch/spec

“We’ll log into your admin with your password.” → Use service accounts + app passwords.

“The AI will edit your theme files.” → Only via staged, tested deployments.

“We guarantee #1 rankings.” → Promise controllable inputs & transparent KPIs instead.

“Real-time 24/7 analysis.” → Daily/bi-weekly health checks with alerts; live only for incidents.

KPIs that actually map to value

Publishing cadence hit rate (% weeks meeting 2× goal).

% pages passing CWV (mobile).

Index coverage errors resolved.

Clicks/CTR (GSC) delta for target clusters.

Refresh velocity (days from decay detection to updated).

Editorial quality score & revision rate.
